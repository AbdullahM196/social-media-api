## API Overview

### Key Technologies:

* **Node.js** and  **Express.js** : For building a fast, modular, and scalable API architecture.
* **TypeScript** : Ensures type safety and improves code quality and maintainability.
* **MongoDB** : Leverages the flexibility and scalability of NoSQL databases for efficient data storage.
* **Firebase Cloud Storage** : Provides seamless image and media file storage.
* **Docker** : Facilitates containerization for consistent environments and version control across different stages of development.

### Core API Functionalities:

* User authentication and profile management.
* Media uploads and storage using Firebase Cloud Storage.
